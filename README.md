# Project Name: CloudCore Fashion [Live Link](https://cloudcore-fashion.vercel.app)


## Short Description of CloudCore Fashion
**CloudCore Fashion** is a responsive product display web application built with React.js to fulfill the Frontend Developer Intern task for CloudCore. It dynamically fetches and displays fashion products using Axios from the provided API. Each product is showcased with a clean, modern design and includes an image sourced from the designated image URL. Users can click on any product to view its detailed information on a dynamic route. The UI is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices. CloudCore Fashion demonstrates my ability to integrate APIs, manage routes, and build user-friendly interfaces with modern frontend technologies.


## Challenges Faced During CloudCore Fashion  
At first, I thought this task would be simple, but I faced some challenges while fetching data from the given APIâ€”especially when trying to fetch a specific product by its ID. The API didn't support fetching a single product directly using an ID, which caused issues in displaying product details on the dynamic route. After multiple attempts, I resolved the problem by fetching all product data first and then filtering the desired product by its ID locally. This approach worked and allowed me to successfully implement the dynamic product detail feature.
